    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a <strong>hands-on engineering leader</strong> with over <strong>16 years of experience</strong> designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native SaaS platforms used by millions worldwide. Currently leading a global team of 20+ engineers at Ideagen, driving innovation and building resilient, multi-tenant applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise spans <strong>Java,.NET Core, Node.js, React, Angular, Python, and Go</strong>, with deep experience in distributed systems, microservices, serverless architectures, and event-driven designs. I specialize in modernizing legacy applications into high-performance single-page applications, ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leveraging containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, I architect scalable infrastructures on AWS and hybrid cloud deployments. I design data solutions using SQL Server, MongoDB, OpenSearch, and vector databases for AI-driven, low-latency analytics and search.
